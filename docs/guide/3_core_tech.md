# 3. Core Technology Requirements

1. **Entity Relationships**

    One-to-many / many-to-many relationship between entities.
    Operations:

    - Retrieving all child entities for a given parent.
    - Creating, updating and deleting child entities associated with a parent. 
    - Implementing a cascading delete.

2. **Use of Date and Time Objects**

    Handling date-related data.

    - Accept and validate date inputs.
    - Using a consistent format.
    - An endpoint that filters by date range / sorts results based on date fields.

3. **Incorporating DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**

    Use DTOs to control data exchanged between the client and server.

    - Separation of concerns by decoupling the internal data model from the API response format.
    - Clean and minimal responses that expose only the required data fields.

4. **Error Handling and Validation**

    Implement structured and meaningful error handling.

    - Validating client input.
    - Appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
    - Clear, consistent error responses.

    Examples:
    - Example: `@Positive` on price ensures inventory values are realistic.
    - Example: `@PastOrPresent` on manufacture dates prevents future entries.\
    Jakarta Validation is used at the DTO level.

5. **Pagination**
    The API supports pagination for endpoints returning collections.

- **Validation Error (400):** Triggered by invalid inputs like negative prices.
- **Resource Not Found (404):** Triggered when a model name does not exist in the database.
